These are my solution to the Advent of Code challenge, which I will update as I complete the challenges
## What is Advent of Code
Advent of Code is a daily challenge from the 1st to the 25th of December, which involves data analytics to solve Christmas-related problems. You can do the challenge by visiting [their website](https://adventofcode.com)

I hope you enjoy coding for the Advent of Code, and do comment if you think I could improve any of my solutions!
